acquire several types of workers
each type of worker will do a specific task for you without being told
  but you need variation, and changing what they will do takes exerting control
  too much exerting control, or too little, loses followers
    - maybe different followers leave first, depending on which end?

need to acquire money, followers, *dedicated* followers, political influence,
  popular opinion, attack surrogates
  maybe: weapons, land, drugs, poison (mass suicide victory condition?)

types of follower:
(green) idealistic: good at getting more followers and making followers dedicated,
default to getting more (idealistic) followers

(red) angry: good at attacking the influence and opinion of others, and for stealing
their followers (and making them angry), default to attacking opinion

(yellow) celebrity: good at popular opinion and money, helpful for getting more celebrity
followers, default to money

(blue) wholesome: good at political influence and money; getting political power is
virtually impossible without wholesome followers, default to popular opinion
  can be created with any followers, but it takes time to get busy

(black) inner circle: can help control your followers and create attack surrogates, but
good at everything; can only be created from dedicated followers, do not need to
be moved away from default

anybody can: buy land with money, buy political influence with money and popular
opinion, recruit followers badly, influence popular opinion weakly, contribute
money weakly
