acquire several types of workers
each type of worker will do a specific task for you without being told
  but you need variation, and changing what they will do takes exerting control
  too much exerting control, or too little, loses followers
    - maybe different followers leave first, depending on which end?

need to acquire money, followers, *dedicated* followers, political influence,
  popular opinion
  maybe: weapons, land, drugs, poison (mass suicide victory condition?)
