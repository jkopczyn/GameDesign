Resolution mechanic: Each player has three dice, each a different color.
    (Probably d6s.) At the end of the game, they will roll them all, and then in
    ascending order by value resolve their abilities. Many abilities will
    contest things with another die; higher value wins contests. Probably this
    roll-off will be done three times.

Important: no decisions occur during the roll-off. Powers are resolved
    automatically.

Drafting mechanic: Deal out a 3x3 grid of powers, face up. Take turns selecting
    one. If you have selected a line of three, TTT-style, pick one more, then
    clear the board and deal a new grid.

could just have an intermediate step where you place the things you've acquired
    into the slots on the dice, but that would be a slog
could require that everything be placed as it's acquired, but that seems unfun.
 If you draft several more cards than slots, and can always overwrite, that
    would be fun, probably.
 Maybe make the TTT bonus let you replace ones you'd bumped, or let you shuffle
    things (probably up to three things) around?


 to make the draft shorter: powers mostly affect *two* slots, except powerful ones

 resolution: line up the dice from lowest to highest (left to right). Resolve
    abilities from left to right. Then compare values; the contests are worth
    4, 7, and 10 points, respectively (high value => higher points).

Dice come in red, green, blue, power boards correspond to color. Possible: power
    cards also come in colors (use SET?) and there is a minor bonus for matching.

Get a thing, either place it immediately or set it aside. You may set aside one
    that was previously in the spot you want.

If you pick the third in a line of three, you place it, then may immediately
    pick one of these two:
        * pick again and place it
        * move some around; up to three, including ones previously set aside
    Then discard the current board and deal another 9.

Power options:
    * +1 to these two values
    * +2 to these two values
    * reroll once if this <= opposing die
    * +1 points if you roll one of these two values
    * +2 points if you roll one of these two values
    * lower die of this pair wins
    * this pair is worth negative points

    "Rares"
    * +3 to this one value
    * +3 points if you roll this value
    * (jump-the-line power) reroll until you don't get this result
    * (jump-the-line power) this pair is worth x2 points (x2 * x2 = x3)
    * (back-of-the-line power) if you lost majority of the round, +5 points
    * just before rolling begins, you may replace this with one set aside


other ideas:
    * (jump-the-line power) this pair is worth x2 points (x2 * x2 = x3)
    * +1 to the lower value. When you pick this, you may place a set-aside
