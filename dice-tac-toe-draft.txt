Resolution mechanic: Each player has three dice, each a different color.
 (Probably d6s.) At the end of the game, they will roll them all, and then in
 ascending order by value resolve their abilities. Many abilities will contest
 things with another die; higher value wins contests. Probably this roll-off will
 be done three times.

Important: no decisions occur during the roll-off. Powers are resolved
 automatically.

Drafting mechanic: Deal out a 3x3 grid of powers, face up. Take turns selecting
 one. If you have selected a line of three, TTT-style, pick one more, then clear
 the board and deal a new grid.

could just have an intermediate step where you place the things you've acquired
 into the slots on the dice, but that would be a slog
could require that everything be placed as it's acquired, but that seems unfun.
 If you draft several more cards than slots, and can always overwrite, that
 would be fun, probably.
 Maybe make the TTT bonus let you replace ones you'd bumped, or let you shuffle
 things (probably up to three things) around?


 to make the draft shorter: powers mostly affect *two* slots, except powerful ones
