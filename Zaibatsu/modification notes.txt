subdecks
base deck: nothing but commodities, seven types in three tiers, four levels of company

nine decks? three vertical, three horizontal
maybe easier, six: two vertical, three horizontal


vertical levels have to match up to the ~10% surplus at each step balance
    - tricky to maintain without increasing the number of symbols (more fiddly to assign)

horizontal levels need to respect vertical-level quota, but not internally
    if two vertical levels (->AAA through ABB->MM, then MMN->U through UU->), flexibility within

card counts need to be stable
