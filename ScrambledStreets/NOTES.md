Gray reads as blacker, lighten or convert to crosshatch pattern.

Intuition that only a line you added to this turn counts.

Weak intuition that you couldn't break up a long line by sliding it from the other axis

The CLL card was hard to use, took a long time and didn't do much. Cs are weak in general?

feeling: too mathy/chessy, computer would be better at it

Freeway aesthetic: cool
Color path/ dryness

Overlay cards instead of slide

Got too hard, not a fun hardness, too long probably

Undoing the damage was frustrating and boring


Squares would be better, keep the cards as a "pocket" version if at all.
