Inspired by passing mention of the word "ludeme" in what I thought was David Parlett's
<a href="http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?id=0140056866" rel="noreferrer">Penguin Book of Word Games</a>,
but which was <a href="http://www.davidparlett.co.uk/gamester/ludemes.html" rel="noreferrer">apparently</a>
his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Oxford-Guide-Card-Games-Historical/dp/0192141651/" rel="noreferrer">Oxford
Guide to Card Games</a>, which I must have been reading at the same time.<br><br>

The Ludemetic (or Ludemic) Game Generator
randomly combines categories and mechanics from those at
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek</a> to create
new (and largely useless) game ideas, with arbitrarily appropriate
titles. It can be used as a source of random inspiration, or
laughed at once and thrown away.<br><br>

Created by <a href="http://kevan.org/">Kevan Davis</a>, December 2003. Leonard's
<a href="http://www.crummy.com/features/dada/boardgame/">BoardGameDadaist</a> is
funnier.
