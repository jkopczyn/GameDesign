How to Keep an Idiot Busy: a number of auto-moving NPC figures move on particular paths; you don't affect them or any win-conditions directly but can alter the board to make them move across paths; each player has some separate VP sources on the board
Alternate name: Wandering Monsters (is that taken?)

Have a dungeon-like map, with a bunch of fork points. There are a bunch of monsters (6 or 7?) who you can't interfere with directly, and who move each round according to a symbol/card system like Arkham Horror.

Different paths have different lengths, and some of them have special areas with symbols on them. Each player has secretly-dealt goals, which are something like "Have a monster destroy <X>", "Keep any monster from finding <X>", or "Make the <M> fight the <N>". When one of these things happens (or at the end of the game, for negative goals), you can redeem the goal card for VP.

After ten rounds, the game ends and scores are totaled.

monsters have a ranking of strength; when two fight, the weaker one loses a full round of movement to recover.
