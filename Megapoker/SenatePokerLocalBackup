In the Senate of the Arcturan Confederation, poker isn’t a metaphor for politics; it’s the real thing. To pick the Prime Minister of Arcturus each decade, the Senators play a tournament of a game human visitors dubbed “Stairwell.” On each hand of cards, votes are staked and committed, with the stakes - and the deck - growing bigger each hand.
When the visitors returned home, they brought with them a variant of the Senate’s great game, which is famed across humanspace as
Arcturan Megapoker!

Structure of the game: Played in seven hands. Each player starts with 20 votes in chips and acquires some more each hand, with more at stake with each successive hand. Additionally, the deck grows starting with a 21-card deck in three suits and ending with a 94-card deck in six suits.

Stairwell is a hold’em-style game; each player gets personal cards dealt face-down, and community cards are dealt face-up. How many cards are dealt changes as the hands progress. The hand is always won by the best five-card hand that a player can assemble from among the community cards and their personal cards; a player must always use at least two of their personal cards for this hand.

When winning a hand, a player does not collect their winnings in chips, but in paper money. All chips in the pot (their bid and all others) return to the bank and the hand winner is given an equal value in cash. However, they do receive some chips: At the beginning of the next round, when every player receives chips, they receive double. (ex. Aater bets 15 on the first hand, Birgo calls, and Charl folds; Aatre and Birgo put their chips into the pot. Birgo wins; 30 chips return to the bank, and Birgo receives $30. At the beginning of the second hand, Birgo receives 20 chips; Aater and Charl receive 10 each.)
