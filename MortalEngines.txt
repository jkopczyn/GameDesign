Mortal Engines: Each person plays a moving city with a few stats, and chases smaller cities to gain their resources and use them to upgrade your own. Use Smallworld map for playtesting, including Lost Tribes as small cities/monsters as medium cities, figure out some straightforward combat mechanic


Stats:

Attack
Defense

Range
Speed

It should be twice as hard to upgrade Range and Speed as to upgrade Attack and Defense. And half as hard to repair damage as to increase.

Standard PC starting city:
Attack 4, Defense 4, Range 1, Speed 2

Microcity: Attack 1, Defense 1, Range 1, Speed 1
Minicity: Attack 2, Defense 2, Range 1, Speed 1
Fortification: Attack 1, Defense 4, Range 2, Speed 0. Defeating a fortification grants no improvements except a total repair. These are placed to wall off sections of the board; confrontations with other players require defeating them first.


Placing NPC cities: At the beginning of the game, place ~3 microcities  per player and ~1 minicity per player. There should be designated spaces where they start.

Every round, place one microcity per player on spaces where they spawned originally. Every other round, place 1 minicity per player.

After about half a game (six rounds?), no longer place microcities, and place minicities every round.
